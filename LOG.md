**Done:**
- Full shop-first redesign shipped to production (Playfair Display + Inter, vermillion accent, CSS design tokens)
- Cart system built: CartProvider, CartDrawer, AddToCartButton (requires SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_TOKEN in Vercel to activate)
- Nav: cart count badge, drawer trigger, collections dropdown
- /shop/collections/[handle] pages with per-collection tag filtering (PRIMARY_TAG map fixes tufted-works→tufting etc.)
- getProductsByTag added to lib/shopify/products.ts
- app/not-found.tsx (branded 404) + public/robots.txt
- Gelato API fully explored: store ID confirmed (51ee1b39), template created (6005fae3), print-files endpoint discovered
- 6 Neko Paw products created in Gelato + Shopify via scripts/seed-gelato-neko.ts
- Artwork uploaded to Vercel Blob (gelato/neko/*.png)
- Print files attached to all 18 variants via scripts/patch-gelato-print-files.ts

**Decisions:**
- Gelato product creation = two-step: create-from-template first, then POST /variants/{id}/print-files separately (imagePlaceholders in the create payload is ignored by the API)
- Cart drawer uses Storefront API — needs separate SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_TOKEN, not covered by Admin client credentials token. Reverted product page to AddToCartButton component but cart won't fully work until token is added to Vercel.
- Template approach confirmed correct but template must be rebuilt with a PORTRAIT placeholder image — current template was built with SHERO patch (landscape 8500×4981px) which causes artwork to render cropped/wrong in Gelato mockups

**Next:**
- BLOCKER: Sebastian must fix the Gelato template (Fine Art Poster, ID: 6005fae3) — edit design, resize image element to fill full portrait bleed area — then delete 6 Neko products and rerun scripts
- Add SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_TOKEN to Vercel env vars (Shopify admin → Apps → Develop apps → Storefront API tab) to activate cart drawer
- Point dayindayin.dk DNS at Vercel (Simply.com)
- Once Gelato template is fixed: run same script pattern for Tourism series (horizontal variants) and SHERO patch
